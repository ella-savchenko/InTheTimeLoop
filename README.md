# InTheTimeLoop
Framework for investigating data remanence in the main memory of virtual machines.

## Workflow
1. write specific patterns inside a virtual machine with writeDATA (InTheTimeLoop/writeDATA)
2. execute multiple experiments automatically with a shell script (InTheTimeLoop/experiments), powering on and off the virtual machine while executing writeDATA and logging the results of experiments (InTheTimeLoop/experiments/logs).
3. evaluate the results of experiments with searchDATA (InTheTimeLoop/searchDATA/evaluation) while searching for the pattern remanences.
4. visualize the evaluationÂ´s results (InTheTimeLoop/searchDATA/visualization).

## Log files and results of experiments
Due to the large size of raw logging data, these were not uploaded here. If you are interested in raw data, please contact me at ella.savchenko@fau.de. For the results of the experiments refer to the evaluated CSV data from raw logging files (searchDATA/evaluation/results*).
